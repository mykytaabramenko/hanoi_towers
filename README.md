This is my first C++ project, which was made as a course work in the university.

The program is a console application made using "windows.h" library and STL (the main task of the course work was not to use any additional libraries). It helps in visualizing the "Hanoi tower" problem and shows how to solve the problem. The program also offers trying to solve the problem by yourself.
